#🌿 Smart Greenhouse System – Arduino Project#

This project is an **automated smart greenhouse system** designed to monitor and control:
- Soil moisture
- Temperature
- Humidity
- Light intensity

The system uses sensors and actuators to maintain optimal growing conditions for plants, fully controlled by an Arduino board.

##  Features

# Soil Moisture Control
- A soil moisture sensor measures soil dryness.
- When the soil becomes dry, the **water pump automatically turns ON**.
- Once moisture returns to a healthy level, the pump turns **OFF** again.

# Temperature & Humidity Monitoring
- A **DHT11** sensor measures temperature & humidity.
- When the temperature exceeds a set threshold (example: 25°C), a **cooling fan** is activated automatically.

# Light Control
- An LDR (light sensor) measures ambient light.
- The greenhouse lighting turns **ON at night** and **OFF during the day**.

# OLED Display
The OLED screen shows real-time:
- Temperature  
- Humidity  
- Soil moisture level
